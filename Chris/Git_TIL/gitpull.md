Today I learned that if you have a simple repository with other people,
you can use git pull to pull changes from the repository that you may have
not initially had when you first downloaded the repository.

An article that helped me visualize this is: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows

Today, I also learned how to fork a repository. The fork button is in the
upper right hand corner of a repository. It makes a repository on your github which
you must clone, and then push to. Then finally, you can make the pull request.
